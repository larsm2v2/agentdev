# Enhanced Email Librarian - Refactored Implementation

This directory contains the refactored implementation of the Enhanced Email Librarian system, following OOP principles to improve maintainability and extensibility.

## Architecture

The refactored system is built around these core components:

1. **AuthManager** - Manages Gmail authentication and credentials
2. **StorageManager** - Manages database and vector storage operations
3. **OrganizerFactory** - Creates appropriate Gmail organizer instances
4. **JobManager** - Manages asynchronous email processing jobs
5. **JobProcessors** - Specific implementations for different job types
6. **APIRouter** - Handles API endpoint routing and request processing
7. **Server** - Main server class that ties everything together

## Design Patterns

The refactoring applies these design patterns:

- **Separation of Concerns** - Each class has a specific responsibility
- **Dependency Injection** - Components are provided with dependencies
- **Factory Pattern** - For creating Gmail organizers
- **Strategy Pattern** - For job processing implementations
- **Template Method** - For standardized job processing flow
- **Repository Pattern** - For database access abstraction

## Benefits

This refactored implementation provides:

1. **Better Testability** - Components can be tested in isolation
2. **Improved Maintainability** - Smaller, focused classes
3. **Enhanced Extensibility** - New job types can be added without modifying existing code
4. **Cleaner Error Handling** - Centralized in appropriate components
5. **Standardized Patterns** - Consistent approach to common operations

## Usage

To use the refactored implementation:

```python
from src.core.email_librarian.main import main

# Create and run the server
app = main()
```

Or run the provided entry point:

```bash
python -m src.core.enhanced_email_librarian_server_refactored
```
