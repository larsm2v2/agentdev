Overall Completeness: ~60-70%
✅ What's Complete:
Basic Structure & Architecture

Modular OOP design is well-structured
Import paths are correctly set up
Main entry point exists and imports properly
Core Interfaces

interfaces.py defines proper protocols and base classes
Type annotations are mostly correct
Authentication Framework

auth_manager.py has Gmail OAuth structure
Token management logic exists
⚠️ What's Incomplete/Missing:
1. Critical Implementation Gaps:
In job_processors.py:

Missing the actual process method implementation
retrieve_emails and process_emails methods are not fully implemented
No error handling for Gmail API failures
In job_manager.py:

Missing register_processor method
create_job method not implemented
No database schema for job tracking
In storage_manager.py:

Database connection logic incomplete
Qdrant vector store integration missing
No table creation/migration logic
In api_router.py:

Many endpoints return placeholder responses
WebSocket implementation missing
No request validation
2. External Dependencies:
Gmail API Integration:

Requires src.gmail.fast_gmail_organizer and src.gmail.gmail_organizer
These files exist but integration may be incomplete
Database Setup:

No database initialization scripts
Missing schema definitions
No migration handling
Configuration:

No environment variable validation
Missing default configuration files
3. Missing Core Logic:

# These methods need implementation:
- JobManager.create_job()
- JobManager.register_processor()
- ShelvingJobProcessor.process()
- CatalogingJobProcessor.process()
- StorageManager.initialize_database()
- APIRouter.setup_websocket_handlers()
